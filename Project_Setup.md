# Situation
The client, faced a challenge in understanding their customer behavior and travel patterns in order to make strategic decisions.
To tackle this challenge, client developed a two-step plan: to identify data sources and to analyze the data.

Using readily available data sources such as the Rewards program database and flight records, client had access to transaction-level data on 1.52 million customers 
who made 1.86 million trips between January 2013 and December 2014. This data included information on how and when trips were booked, customer demographics,
loyalty program status, and more.

We analyzed the de-identified data and identified insights related to customer segments, travel patterns, and other useful information.
The findings were presented to client, enabling the client to make data-driven decisions and gain a better understanding of their customers.
